## Overview

**The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the world’s most popular sporting events, attracting millions of viewers each season. This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on IPL viewership and advertising revenue data to uncover business insights, understand audience patterns, and evaluate the impact of sponsorships and broadcasting.**

### Objectives

Perform EDA on IPL viewership & revenue datasets.

Analyze season-wise and team-wise viewership trends.

Study ad revenue performance and correlation with viewership.

Identify key factors driving audience engagement.

Provide data-backed recommendations for advertisers, broadcasters, and IPL stakeholders.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps

Data Cleaning

Handling missing values.

Standardizing formats (season, teams, sponsors).

Univariate Analysis

Distribution of viewership across years.

Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis

Correlation between viewership & ad revenue.

Relationship between match type (league/playoff/final) and audience size.

Visualization

Line charts comparing TV vs Digital audiences.


### Key Insights

**Digital platforms are driving exponential growth, with streaming viewership rising faster than TV.**

 Teams with higher star player engagement attract more ad revenue and sponsorships.

 Sponsorship changes (Vivo → Dream11 → Tata) had a visible impact on brand exposure and overall revenue patterns.

### Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

Excel/CSV datasets (viewership, ad revenue, sponsorship data)
### Conclusion
IPL is not just a cricket tournament but a business ecosystem.

**Viewership has consistently grown, especially on digital platforms, opening new opportunities for advertisers.**

**Ad revenues peak during marquee matches and playoffs, making them prime slots for brands.**

**The analysis highlights the strategic importance of sponsorship deals, brand placement, and digital engagement in driving IPL’s business success**
